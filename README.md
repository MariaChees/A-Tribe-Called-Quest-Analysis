# A-Tribe-Called-Quest-Analysis
Analysis of messages portrayed through the music by the hip hop group, A Tribe Called Quest.
I analyzed all of the songs in all of the major albums by the hip hop group, A Tribe Called Quest. The unit of analysis is the songs in their discography and I collected 91 observations. I gathered the data by first ordering all of the songs that I would be analyzing from 1 to 91. I used a random number generator to pick which songs to analyze. After picking each song, I listened to it and closely read the lyrics to measure my variables. The four concepts that I measured were discussion of race, ethnicity, and/or culture within the lyrics, discussion of poverty and/or class inequalities within the lyrics, mood of the instrumentals, and message expressed through the lyrics. 
Variable 1: Discussion of race, ethnicity, and/or culture within the lyrics. The concept that is shown through this variable is the expression and representation of race/ethnicity/culture through music. I measured this concept by counting the number of times that race/ethnicity/culture were mentioned within the lyrics of each song. I used a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being "not mentioned at all" and 10 being "mentioned 10 or more times". I decided to use this method to measure the concept because I thought it would be the most simple and straightforward way to see the emphasis on the subjects by the artists. By measuring the amount of times that these subjects were mentioned in each song, I was able to see how much the artists emphasize the concept in their music. 
Variable 2: Discussion of poverty and/or class inequalities within the lyrics. The concept that is shown through this variable is expression of the struggles of poverty and class inequalities through music. I measured this concept by counting the number of times that poverty/class were mentioned within the lyrics of each song. I used a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being "not mentioned at all" and 10 being "mentioned 10 or more times". I decided to use this method to measure the concept because I thought it would be the most simple and straightforward way to see the emphasis on the subjects by the artists. By measuring the amount of times that these subjects were mentioned in each song, I was able to see how much the artists emphasize the concept in their music. 
Variable 3: Mood of the instrumentals. The concept that is shown through this variable is self-expression and feelings portrayed through the sound of music. I measured this concept by
